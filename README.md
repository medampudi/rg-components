# Local Serverless Components

Examples applications and components that I have been working on before they get merged to the main Serverless Components [registry](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/master/registry).

## Examples

* [AWS Billing Alarm app](https://github.com/rupakg/rg-components/tree/master/rg-examples/cw-billing-alarm-app) - A sample app that triggers an alarm when AWS Billing estimated charges goes beyond a specified threshold. It then sends out an email with the details.

## Components

* [aws-cloudwatch-metric-alarm](https://github.com/rupakg/rg-components/tree/master/rg-registry/aws-cloudwatch-metric-alarm) - A Serverless Component that provisions a AWS CloudWatch Metric Alarm based on parameters set by the user.
